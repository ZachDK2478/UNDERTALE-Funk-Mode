        <h2>Happy Summer!</h2>
        <h3>Written by one of the lead composers, ZachDK</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Hey all! I hope you're having a good summer. We have a lot of good stuff prepared for you today!</p>
        <br>
        <p>This is our first newsletter, and my first time programming a website really, so I hope you enjoy this fun little site.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In terms of development, UNDERTALE: Funk-Mode is going well! Aside from minor complications when it comes to people's personal lives interfering with work, we haven't let anything get in the way of creating the best mod possible.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We hope you enjoy the final product, but even more so, we're thankful for your patience and the care and respect you've shown us. We will eternally be grateful for you all, and we can't wait for you to get a chance to play this mod.</p>
        <br>
        <p>With that said, enjoy the rest of the newsletter! I'll see you in the next section.</p>

            <h2>The State of the OST</h2>
            <h3>Written by one of the lead composers, ZachDK</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Well, here it is! The OST discussion.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Music is one of the most important parts of a Friday Night Funkin' mod. Shocker, I know. But I'm glad to say that Undertale: Funk-Mode is in good hands.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The team has four lead composers. Me, GontheGhost, Spunky Tunky, and Soba Noodles. We, alongside many of the other composers, have been working very hard to contribute to this mod and make it's OST the best it can be.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I'm very proud of our work, and we can't wait to get all of this out to you. Undertale: Funk-Mode has really been a wonderful experience to work on. I've learned and improved with each passing day, working on this mod. I hope you guys learn
                and improve as well, in your own personal projects.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It's thanks to you all that we can even make this mod!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Here are some of the songs we've been given permission to show you.</p>

                <h2>Coding Struggles pt. 1</h2>
                <h3>Written by the Lead Programmer, Glintfish</h3>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Hello, im glintfish, lead programmer for Undertale: Funk Mode!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Damn, this mod has been in the works for an entire year now. Its kinda crazy to think about! Ive been in this community for around 4 years now, and to think about how Funk Mode has been here for a fourth of it is... idk! Weird i guess?
                    But a good kind of weird. Time flies by fast!</p>
                <br>
                <p>I know you didnt come here to read about my life story so ill cut it short and move onto the coding for the mod.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Lets not beat around the bush, coding is the main thing keeping this mod from coming out. Who would've guessed that coding is really hard!</p>
                <br>
                <p>Generally the thing thats been the biggest issue is planning ahead. We as the coders wanna make the mod as easy as possible to develop for, so that future updates can come out faster, but that also means a lot of planning, a lot of rewrites
                    and refactors, and a LOT of code... Although, not really.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Im not going to lie, im an optimization nut. I love optimizing and squeezing as much performance as i can out of literally anything, and im especially doing it now because i want EVERYONE to be able to experience Funk Mode without any
                    issues.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>As of writing (3. May 2025.), the mod has ~3200 lines of code. compared to Psych 0.7.3's ~31000 or our old engines ~10000, and you can see the difference! I didn't want useless code and random stuff cluttering the codebase, so we ended
                    up switching engines to one I was in the process of working on, which turned out to be a huge success!</p>
                <br>
                <p>Everything is insanely modular, easy to work with and understand, and also DOCUMENTED, unlike literally every other FNF mod / engine out there. I dont wanna sound like im bragging, but im just insanely happy with the way everything was
                    done for this mod.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Now back to the actual progress. Again, as of writing, I just finished the mods new overworld implementation, and it works like a charm. Honestly, we don't really have that much stuff left to finish! Unfortunately, I am usually the one
                    pulling most of the weight as our other coders are fairly busy, but I don't mind that- I like working on Funk Mode!</p>
                <br>
                <p>This is what it looked like before I fixed it LMAO</p>
                <br>
                <img src="assets/images/coding-struggles/fuckkkkk.png" alt="fuck" title="fuck.overworld">
                <br>
                <p>I am thinking about open sourcing Funk Mode once it releases, but at the same time, I don't want people blatantly stealing all my hard work, which is what the community usually does. I dunno, we'll see when the time comes!</p>
                <br>
                <p>That's it for now, thanks for reading!</p>
                <br>

                    <br>
                    <p>Hello again! Yep, that's right, it's me!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Turns out one of the lead composers is actually the coder for the newsletter. Yep, that's right.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This newsletter has taken a lot of effort for me to get done. Initially, this was meant to be a Spring 2025 Newsletter. As you can tell, it ended up being a Summer themed newsletter instead.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I've tried to make it as readable and user-friendly as possible. Even though things have been tough, I can only pray that my efforts weren't in vain.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        UNDERTALE: Funk-Mode is honestly the first mod I've ever worked on, and it has been a BLAST lemme tell ya. The dev team is so kind, and Gian and Danon have bene AMAZING directors. I honestly feel at home here--which is good for a mod of this scale.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>There isn't really much else for me to say, to be honest. I suppose I could share some screenshots Glintfish shared with me on the progress of coding the mod.</p>

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <p>Pico is officially confirmed for the mod. With luck he will appear in this demo. We already have a good couple of ideas for him, with some things in the works. Pico's story will be centered around the events of Undertale Yellow. He
                        will encounter characters like Dalv, Martlet, Starlo, etc. etc.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>On the topic of playable characters from the FNF universe, we still don't have anything for anyone else. We know that there are people who want to see Nene or even Senpai, but there are currently no plans for them. Our priority is
                        for the main gameplay of Funk-Mode first, and playable characters second.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Even so, if we find a couple ideas and ways to include them, you can trust that Pico won't be the only character featured in the mod!</p>

                    <p>UNDERTALE: Funk-Mode has had quite a lot of trailers, and we're very happy to show them to you.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>These should help give you a good idea of the mod, from the art style to the gameplay.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Don't forget to support the Ramware Broadcast, along with Soundwave Transmission. These trailers couldn't have been made without them.</p>
