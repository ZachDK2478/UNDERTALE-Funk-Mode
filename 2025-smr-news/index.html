            <p>

                Hey all! I hope you're having a good summer. We have a lot of good stuff prepared for you today!
                This is our first newsletter, and my first time programming a website really, so I hope you enjoy this
                fun little site.

                <br><br>In terms of development, UNDERTALE: Funk-Mode is going well! Aside from minor complications when
                it comes to people's personal lives interfering with work, we haven't let anything get in the way of
                creating the best mod possible.
                <br><br>We hope you enjoy the final product, but even more so, we're thankful for your patience and the
                care and respect you've shown us. We will eternally be grateful for you all, and we can't wait for you
                to get a chance to play this mod.

                <br><br>With that said, enjoy the rest of the newsletter! I'll see you in the next section.

            <p>Well, here it is! The OST discussion.

                <br><br>Music is one of the most important parts of a Friday Night Funkin' mod. Shocker, I know. But I'm
                glad to say that Undertale: Funk-Mode is in good hands.
                The team has four lead composers. Me (ZachDK), GontheGhost, Spunky Tunky, and Soba Noodles. We,
                alongside many of the other composers, have been working very hard to contribute to this mod and make
                it's OST the best it can be.

                <br><br>I'm very proud of our work, and we can't wait to get all of this out to you. Undertale:
                Funk-Mode has really been a wonderful experience to work on. I've learned and improved with each passing
                day, working on this mod. I hope you guys learn
                and improve as well, in your own personal projects. It's thanks to you all that we can even make this
                mod!

                <br><br>Here are some of the songs we've been given permission to show you.
                <br>Enjoy!

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>Hello, im glintfish, lead programmer for Undertale: Funk Mode!
                <br><br>Damn, this mod has been in the works for an entire year now. Its kinda crazy to think about!
                Ive been in this community for around 4 years now, and to think about how Funk Mode has been here
                for a fourth of it is... idk! Weird i guess?

                <br>But a good kind of weird. Time flies by fast!

                <br><br>I know you didn't come here to read about my life story so I'll cut it short and move onto the
                coding for the mod.
                Lets not beat around the bush, coding is the main thing keeping this mod from coming out. Who would've
                guessed that coding is really hard!

                <br>Generally the thing thats been the biggest issue is planning ahead. We as the coders wanna make the
                mod as easy as possible to develop for,
                so that future updates can come out faster, but that also means a lot of planning, a lot of rewrites and
                refactors, and a LOT of code...
                <br>Although, not really.

                <br><br>Im not going to lie, im an optimization nut. I love optimizing and squeezing as much performance
                as i can out of literally anything, and
                im especially doing it now because i want EVERYONE to be able to experience Funk Mode without any
                issues.

                <br><br>As of writing (3. May 2025.), the mod has ~3200 lines of code. compared to Psych 0.7.3's ~31000
                or our old engines ~10000,
                and you can see the difference! I didn't want useless code and random stuff cluttering the codebase, so
                we ended up switching engines
                to one I was in the process of working on, which turned out to be a huge success!

                <br>Everything is insanely modular, easy to work with and understand, and also DOCUMENTED, unlike
                literally every other FNF mod / engine out there.
                I dont wanna sound like im bragging, but im just insanely happy with the way everything was done for
                this mod.

                <br><br>Now back to the actual progress. Again, as of writing, I just finished the mods new overworld
                implementation, and it works like a charm.
                Honestly, we don't really have that much stuff left to finish! Unfortunately, I am usually the one
                pulling most of the weight as our other coders
                are fairly busy, but I don't mind that- I like working on Funk Mode!

                <br><br><br><br>this is what it looked like before glint fixed it LMAO

                    alt="fuck.overworld" title="fuck.overworld">

                <br>I am thinking about open sourcing Funk Mode once it releases, but at the same time, I don't want
                people blatantly stealing all my hard work,
                which is what the community usually does. I dunno, we'll see when the time comes!

                <br>That's it for now, thanks for reading!

            <p> Hey there.

                <br><br>As a lead composer and the only person programming this website and upholding it, I've certainly
                got some stories to tell.

                <br>This website's link is admittedly pretty long, and I have to apologize for that. This website is
                made through GitHub Pages, and I
                don't exactly want to pay to get a custom domain.

                <br><br>This newsletter has been a long time coming. I've been working on this for months. Originally,
                it was supposed to be a Spring Newsletter,
                but as you can see it's become a Sumemr Newsletter instead.
