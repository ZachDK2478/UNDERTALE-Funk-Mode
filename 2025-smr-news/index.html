                Hey all! I hope you're having a good summer. We have a lot of good stuff prepared for you today!
                This is our first newsletter, and my first time programming a website really, so I hope you enjoy this
                fun little site.

                <br><br>In terms of development, UNDERTALE Funk-Mode is going well! Aside from minor complications when
                it comes to people's personal lives interfering with work, we haven't let anything get in the way of
                creating the best mod possible.
                <br><br>We hope you enjoy the final product, but even more so, we're thankful for your patience and the
                care and respect you've shown us. We will eternally be grateful for you all, and we can't wait for you
                to get a chance to play this mod.

                <br><br>With that said, enjoy the rest of the newsletter! I'll see you in the next section.

            <p>Well, here it is! The OST discussion.

                <br><br>Music is one of the most important parts of a Friday Night Funkin' mod. Shocker, I know. But I'm
                glad to say that Undertale Funk-Mode is in good hands.
                The team has four lead composers. Me (ZachDK), GontheGhost, Spunky Tunky, and Soba Noodles. We,
                alongside many of the other composers, have been working very hard to contribute to this mod and make
                it's OST the best it can be.

                <br><br>I'm very proud of our work, and we can't wait to get all of this out to you. Undertale:
                Funk-Mode has really been a wonderful experience to work on. I've learned and improved with each passing
                day, working on this mod. I hope you guys learn
                and improve as well, in your own personal projects. It's thanks to you all that we can even make this
                mod!

                <br><br>Here are some of the songs we've been given permission to show you.
                <br>Enjoy!

            <p>Hello, im glintfish, lead programmer for
                <a href="../gameless-behavior/" class="hidden-link">Undertale Funk Mode!</a>
                <br><br>Damn, this mod has been in the works for an entire year now. Its kinda crazy to think about!
                Ive been in this community for around 4 years now, and to think about how Funk Mode has been here
                for a fourth of it is... idk! Weird i guess?

                <br>But a good kind of weird. Time flies by fast!

                <br><br>I know you didn't come here to read about my life story so I'll cut it short and move onto the
                coding for the mod.
                Lets not beat around the bush, coding is the main thing keeping this mod from coming out. Who would've
                guessed that coding is really hard!

                <br>Generally the thing thats been the biggest issue is planning ahead. We as the coders wanna make the
                mod as easy as possible to develop for,
                so that future updates can come out faster, but that also means a lot of planning, a lot of rewrites and
                refactors, and a LOT of code...
                <br>Although, not really.

                <br><br>Im not going to lie, im an optimization nut. I love optimizing and squeezing as much performance
                as i can out of literally anything, and
                im especially doing it now because i want EVERYONE to be able to experience Funk Mode without any
                issues.

                <br><br>As of writing (3. May 2025.), the mod has ~3200 lines of code. compared to Psych 0.7.3's ~31000
                or our old engines ~10000,
                and you can see the difference! I didn't want useless code and random stuff cluttering the codebase, so
                we ended up switching engines
                to one I was in the process of working on, which turned out to be a huge success!

                <br>Everything is insanely modular, easy to work with and understand, and also DOCUMENTED, unlike
                literally every other FNF mod / engine out there.
                I dont wanna sound like im bragging, but im just insanely happy with the way everything was done for
                this mod.

                <br><br>Now back to the actual progress. Again, as of writing, I just finished the mods new overworld
                implementation, and it works like a charm.
                Honestly, we don't really have that much stuff left to finish! Unfortunately, I am usually the one
                pulling most of the weight as our other coders
                are fairly busy, but I don't mind that- I like working on Funk Mode!

                <br><br><br><br>this is what it looked like before glint fixed it LMAO

                    title="fuck.overworld">

                <br>I am thinking about open sourcing Funk Mode once it releases, but at the same time, I don't want
                people blatantly stealing all my hard work,
                which is what the community usually does. I dunno, we'll see when the time comes!

            <p> Hey there!

                <br><br>As one of the mod's lead composers and the sole developer maintaining this website, I've got
                some stories to share.


                <br><br>First off, I'll admit the website link is a bit long—sorry about that! It's hosted through
                GitHub Pages,
                and I'm not exactly eager to pay for a custom domain…

                <br>This newsletter has been a long time coming. I've been working on it for months. Originally, it was
                meant to be a Spring Newsletter,
                but as you can clearly see, it's turned into…

                <br><br><br><br><br>not...
                <br><br><br>that.

                <br><br><br><br><br>I've done my best to make it readable and user-friendly. I hope my efforts aren't in
                vain, lmao

                <br><br>Like Glintfish mentioned, I've also been working to make it modular and easy to navigate. While
                I'm currently the only
                person working on this site, I'm deliberately designing the code so that if someone ever joins me, it'll
                be clear and
                easy for them to understand!

                <br><br>UNDERTALE Funk-Mode is honestly the first mod I've ever worked on, and it has been a BLAST lemme
                tell ya.
                <br>The dev team is so kind, and Gian and Danon have bene AMAZING directors! I honestly feel at home
                here—which is good for a mod of this scale.

                <br><br>This website has had it's code <a href="../REDACTED/" class="hidden-link">deleted</a> and remade
                multiple times over at this point,
                and I'm pretty proud of how it looks right now!
                <br>

                <br>There isn't really much else for me to say, to be honest. I suppose I could share some screenshots
                Glintfish shared with me
                on the progress of coding the mod!

                Pico is officially confirmed for the mod. With luck, he will appear in the upcoming demo.
                <br>We already have a good couple of ideas for him, with some things in the works.
                Pico's story will be centered around the events of Undertale Yellow, but will have fewer songs compared
                to that
                of Bfriend.

                <br><br>On the topic of playable characters from the FNF universe, we still don't have anything for
                anyone else.
                <br>We know that there are people who want to see Nene or even Senpai, but there are currently no plans
                for them.
                Our priority is for the main gameplay to be finished first, and the playable characters second.

                <br><br>Even so, if we find a couple ideas and ways to include them, you can trust that Pico won't
                be the only character featured in the mod!

                looks.
                We've been hard at work on the mod, and while the overworld is our primary focus currently, don't think
                we've
                forgotten about the music and art!

                This one went unused because it didn't fit the vibe of Your Best Friend. A little too...somber?

                This is the first version of Your Best Guide that I made. I'm actually kind of happy with it,
                though that doesn't change that a better version exists now.

                This was a very basic mockup for Croak, made with a couple silly synths.

                <br> All of these were supposed to play as you browsed the newsletter, but I wasn't
                able to find a way to have them stop playing once listening to something else in the newsletter.

                <br><br> Because of this, the newsletter is now silent. However, I wanted to keep these here as unused content
                because I actually like them. Especially that first one, I think it's a nice little rendition of
                "Uwa!! So temperate".

                <br><br>Now...

                <br><br><br>Time for the juiciest of unused songs...........
